Python Pond Quiz for Pygame Zero
================================

Let's use the excellent `Mu`_ editor and `PygameZero`_ library
to build a simple quiz in Python. You could pick any topic -- here
we're using pond life. 

This tutorial is not too hard, it should be suitable for beginners. 

Getting set up
--------------

See `Mu`_ for download links and instructions for installing Mu on
your platform.

The Mu installer also installs PyGame and PyGame zero.

If you have any trouble installing Mu, as a fallback you can download
PortaMu from that same page. You donâ€™t need a pen drive as the website
suggests, PortaMu will simply run anywhere without being
installed. Just download and unzip on to your desktop.

It is not advised not to run the portable and the fully installed
version of Mu on the same system, as they can sometimes interfere and
break both installations.

Launching Mu
------------

The first time you start Mu you might be asked which mode you want to
work in. For this project you will be using PyGame Zero. If you
already have Mu open in a different mode you can switch using the mode
button in the top left.
